# nRF24L01-Frequency Hopping (FHSS)

This is my algoritm to do a FHSS with nRF24L01 and Arduino.
The code is very simple but it implements many control and reliability features that make it particularly robust.
I hope you can find it useful for your projects.

You will find all the details in the code comments
